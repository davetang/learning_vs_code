# VS Code

My notes on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as I try to learn more about it.

## Installation

Download from <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=linux64_deb> and [then install](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux#_debian-and-ubuntu-based-distributions):

```console
sudo apt install ./code_1.106.3-1764110892_amd64.deb
```

Run VS Code.

```console
code
```

## Getting started

* **Left sidebar**: File explorer, search, Git integration, extensions
* **Editor**: Where you edit files
* **Bottom panel**: Terminal, problems, output
* **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P or F1): Search for any command

The integrated terminal

* Press `` Ctrl+` `` (backtick) or go to View -> Terminal. This gives you a command line inside VS Code.

Click the Extensions icon in the left sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X) and search for:

* **Python**
* **GitLens** (enhanced Git features)
* **Remote - SSH**
